Project Title: ClimateScope – Global Weather Analysis Dashboard  
Student Name: Mallepalle Sri Meghana  
Mentor: Bhoomika MalliReddy  
Internship: Infosys Internship 2025  

--------------------------------------------

1. Objective  
The goal of this milestone is to finalize, test, and document the ClimateScope dashboard project.  
This includes validating data accuracy, ensuring the functionality of all visualizations,  
and producing a comprehensive final report that summarizes insights and methodology.

---------------------------------------------

2. Methodology  
The project follows a structured data analytics workflow:  
- Data Collection: Gathered weather datasets from multiple sources.  
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed the data using Python (pandas, numpy).  
- Dashboard Development: Created interactive dashboards using React.js and Power BI.  
- Testing: Validated data consistency, accuracy of visualizations, and dashboard responsiveness.  

---------------------------------------------

3. Data Testing & Validation  
- Verified data loading and preprocessing functions using milestone4_dashboard_testing.py.  
- Ensured the dataset (Clean_GlobalWeatherRepository.csv) loads correctly.  
- Checked for null values, duplicates, and data type consistency.  
- Confirmed all charts display accurate information based on filtered inputs.  

---------------------------------------------

4. Insights & Analysis  
- Regional climate trends show that temperature variations and precipitation rates differ across continents.  
- Global insights highlight an upward trend in average temperature and more unpredictable rainfall patterns.  
- Data reveals clear regional disparities in weather changes over the years.  

---------------------------------------------

5. Dashboard Evaluation  
- The dashboard allows users to interactively filter data by region and year.  
- Visualizations (line charts, bar charts, maps) provide clear insights.  
- User experience tested for performance and responsiveness across devices.  
- All functionalities work as expected with no major bugs found.  

---------------------------------------------

6. Future Enhancements  
- Add live weather API integration for real-time updates.  
- Implement predictive analytics for temperature and rainfall forecasting.  
- Enhance UI/UX with additional data visualization tools.  
- Consider cloud deployment for scalability and multi-user access.  

---------------------------------------------

7. Conclusion  
The ClimateScope dashboard is now fully functional, tested, and stable.  
It successfully provides meaningful insights into regional and global weather trends.  
This milestone marks the completion of a data-driven project combining data science, analytics, and visualization.
